**Benefits of React**
  1. Declarative
  2. Component-Based
  3. Learn Once, Write Anywhere

Before starting with React, let's assume you have basic understanding of *HTML, CSS and JavaScript*. It is Recommended to know about **DOM**.
**DOM** stands for *Document Object Model*. Refer [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

###### Document Object Model
DOM is a programming interface for web documents. DOM is a structured representation of the HTML elements that are present in a webpage or web-app. DOM represents the entire UI of your application. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. Parsing the DOM tree for updating changes to certain elements on the page takes much time.

**In React, the concept of Virtual DOM is used.**
